# 14 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning
## Overview
We will now cover several advanced machine learning techniques and applications, including recommendation systems, anomaly detection, time series analysis and basic neural networks. The goal is to get acquainted with the basics of these applications, not necessarily to master them. During this unit, you will also start working on Capstone Project 2.

## 14.1 Recommendation Systems
Recommendation systems are everywhere; from Amazon recommending books and products, Netflix recommending movies, to Facebook and Twitter recommending posts that you might like. But how do they work? Let's find out!

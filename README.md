# Data Science Career Track
A warm welcome to the Springboard Data Science Career Track Program!  
In this course, you'll cover a lot of technical material: Python and the Python data science stack, including pandas and scikit-learn, data wrangling, machine learning, recommendation systems, time series analysis and the basics of data engineering. You'll work on two Capstone Projects which will help you hone all of your technical skills and create a solid, industry-worthy portfolio.  
In addition to the technical materials, we’ve put together the best career resources and support you can find. One of the common mistakes we’ve seen students make in the past is to wait too long to start their job search. We want to make sure that you start the foundational work of a career transition: the research, networking, informational interviews, early on, since that’ll pay off later in the form of leads and interviews.
